            <alinea>As the population of the world continues to increase beyond 7 billion, and
                    agricultural pests continue to rapidly evolve resistance to pesticides, it is
                    becoming ever more important to cultivate arable land in a way that is
                    sustainable for both humans and the environment. A better understanding of the
                    different mechanisms used by wild plants to deter herbivores will help to
                    increase crop production without harming the environment.</alinea>
         </para>
         <para>
            <alinea>Plants use both direct and indirect methods to fend off herbivores. Direct
                    defense methods include the production of chemicals that are toxic to herbivores
                    or give them indigestion, and the growth of sticky prickles and spines that can
                    injure or kill the herbivore. Indirect defense methods, on the other hand,
                    generally rely on the plant attracting organisms that are either predators or
                    parasites of the herbivore.</alinea>
         </para>
         <para>
            <alinea>Plants produce odors known as herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that are
                    thought to offer indirect defense against herbivores by betraying their location
                    to predators and parasites. However, HIPVs also influence other members of the
                    ecological community, sometimes in ways that are detrimental to plants.
                    Moreover, despite 30 years of research, no study has demonstrated that HIPVs
                    increase the fitness of a plant, so it is unclear what they have evolved to
                    do.</alinea>
         </para>
         <para>
            <alinea>Now, a 2-year field study by Schuman et al. has shown plants
                    that emit green leaf volatiles (which are a type of HIPV) produce twice as many
                    buds and flowers&#x2014;a measure of fitness&#x2014;as plants that have been genetically
                    engineered not to emit green leaf volatiles. This study was conducted with
                        Nicotiana attenuata, which is a wild tobacco plant that is
                    often targeted by Manduca sexta, a type of moth that is also
                    known as the tobacco hornworm. Green leaf volatiles only increased plants'
                    fitness when various species of Geocoris&#x2014;a bug that preys on
                        Manduca sexta&#x2014;reduced the number of herbivores by a factor
                    of two. This is the first evidence that HIPVs offer indirect defense against
                    herbivores.</alinea>
         </para>
         <para>
            <alinea>Schuman et al. also studied the effects of molecules called
                    protease inhibitors that are thought to function as direct defenses by making it
                    difficult for herbivores to digest plants. They found that the ability to
                    produce protease inhibitors did not increase the fitness of plants under
                    herbivore attack; however, tobacco hornworms that had been fed plants containing
                    protease inhibitors were found to be more sluggish in response to attack, which
                    suggests that protease inhibitors can enhance the indirect defenses of plants.
                    The results suggest that employing both direct and indirect defenses&#x2014;such as a
                    combination of biological pesticides and genetic engineering to produce both
                    HIPVs and protease inhibitors&#x2014;is the best approach for defending agricultural
                    plants against pests.</alinea>

         <para>
            <alinea>Plant indirect defenses are traits that disable or remove herbivores by manipulating
                tri-trophic interactions to the advantage of the plant (Price et al., 1980). They attract and inform the third
                trophic level, predators or parasitoids, resulting in increased attacks on
                herbivores (Turlings and Wäckers, 2004).
                Indirect defenses are widespread and include domatia, extrafloral nectar, and food
                bodies which provide shelter and nutrition for predators and parasitoids, as well as
                herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) which convey information about feeding
                herbivores (Heil, 2008). Field studies with
                the native tobacco Nicotiana attenuata, a desert annual, and with
                maize have shown that HIPVs can reduce herbivore loads by 24% to more than 90%, by
                increasing both predation and parasitization of herbivores (Kessler and Baldwin, 2001; Rasmann et al., 2005; Halitschke et
                    al., 2008; Degenhardt et al.,
                    2009; Allmann and Baldwin, 2010)
                and deterring herbivore oviposition (Kessler and
                    Baldwin, 2001).</alinea>
         </para>
         <para>
            <alinea>If HIPVs really function as defenses, they should increase Darwinian fitness, defined
                as successful reproduction, for plants under herbivore attack (Karban and Baldwin, 1997). But because HIPVs can be perceived
                by many other members of the ecological community&#x2014;from herbivores, pollinators,
                predators and parasitoids to competing or parasitic plants&#x2014;it is not clear whether
                HIPVs increase plant fitness in nature (Dicke and
                    Baldwin, 2010; Kessler and Heil,
                    2011). The field studies described above have either spanned too short a
                time to reveal Darwinian fitness benefits, or have not reported fitness data at all
                    (Kessler and Baldwin, 2001; Rasmann et al., 2005; Halitschke et al., 2008; Degenhardt et al., 2009; Allmann and
                    Baldwin, 2010). Two laboratory studies showed that parasitization of
                herbivores can increase plant reproduction (van
                    Loon et al., 2000; Hoballah and
                    Turlings, 2001), but the parasitization in these studies was not mediated
                by HIPVs. Hence three decades after their description, it remains unclear whether
                HIPVs are really indirect defenses.</alinea>
         </para>
         <para>
            <alinea>Long-term field studies comparing HIPV-emitting vs -deficient plants are required in
                order to demonstrate a defensive function for HIPVs. Experimental additions of pure
                volatiles or mixes to plants growing in nature has worked well to test short-term
                effects of specific compounds (Kessler and
                    Baldwin, 2001; Allmann and Baldwin,
                    2010), but only endogenously produced HIPV emissions can ensure specific,
                lasting and consistent differences under field conditions. Most evidence for the
                utility of HIPVs comes from studies in which predators and parasitoids learn to
                associate HIPVs with prey; naïve predators and parasitoids are just as likely to
                respond to HIPVs as not to respond (Allison and
                    Hare, 2009). Thus the inducibility of HIPV emission, which ensures
                association with herbivore feeding, is likely essential for HIPV function, but it is
                difficult to engineer (Kos et al., 2009).
                Engineered constitutive HIPV emissions have been used, either on predators and
                parasitoids trained to associate target volatiles with prey in short-term laboratory
                experiments (Kappers et al., 2005; Schnee et al., 2006), or in set-ups in which
                target volatiles are always associated with prey (Rasmann et al., 2005; Degenhardt et
                    al., 2009). When plants are engineered constitutively to emit HIPVs, they
                no longer provide accurate information about the location of feeding herbivores, and
                predators will not associate these signals with prey in nature. Genetically
                silencing the biosynthesis of HIPVs, however, permits naturally inducible wild-type
                (WT) plants to serve as HIPV emitters, for comparison with transformed lines lacking
                specific volatile components (Halitschke et al.,
                    2008; Skibbe et al., 2008).
                Furthermore, field experiments that manipulate the production of HIPVs which not
                only attract the third trophic level, but also influence the second trophic level
                (e.g., as feeding stimulants and host location cues), require additional
                experimental manipulations to preserve the plant-herbivore part of the tritrophic
                interaction.</alinea>
         </para>
         <para>
            <alinea>When HIPVs do attract the third trophic level, how can herbivores adapt? Many
                herbivores can outgrow their vulnerability to predators and parasitoids, but plant
                direct defenses can slow herbivore growth and prolong vulnerability as postulated by
                the slow growth-high mortality hypothesis (Benrey
                    and Denno, 1997; Williams, 1999;
                    Kessler and Baldwin, 2001, 2004; Kaplan and Thaler, 2011). The solanaceous specialists Manduca
                    sexta and M. quinquemaculata (Lepidoptera, Sphingidae)
                are resistant to the potent alkaloid toxin nicotine (Wink and Theile, 2002), but sensitive to the nutritional
                value of plant tissue (Zavala and Baldwin,
                    2004). Non-toxic protease inhibitor (PI) proteins, which inhibit protein
                digestion and thus decrease the availability of organic nitrogen in the form of
                amino acids (Zavala et al., 2008), are
                widespread in flowering plants (Hartl et al.,
                    2011), and trypsin protease inhibitors (TPIs) slow the growth of
                    M. sexta on N. attenuata (Zavala et al., 2008). However, herbivores can
                overcome PIs by producing insensitive or desensitized proteases, inactivating or
                degrading PIs, eating more plant tissue, and eating more nutritious young tissue
                    (Winterer and Bergelson, 2001; Steppuhn and Baldwin, 2007; Zavala et al., 2008). In the latter two
                cases, PIs could reduce plant fitness. Although TPI-producing N.
                    attenuata plants produce more seeds than TPI-deficient plants when
                attacked by M. sexta under controlled glasshouse conditions (Zavala and Baldwin, 2004), whether TPIs
                function as a direct defense in nature is unknown.</alinea>
         </para>
         <para>
            <alinea>We tested the hypotheses that HIPVs and TPIs defend plants in nature by increasing
                herbivore predation and thereby plant Darwinian fitness. To do so, we monitored the
                performance, predation and mortality of Manduca spp. (M.
                    sexta and M. quinquemaculata) on wild-type N.
                    attenuata plants and RNAi transformed lines silenced for the production
                either of a specific group of HIPVs, or of TPIs, and compared the resulting plant
                reproductive output in terms of bud and flower production (we are not permitted to
                allow transgenic plants to disperse ripe seed). Because N.
                    attenuata is an annual, opportunistic out-crosser, seeds are produced
                within one growing season, mostly from fertilization via self-pollen (Sime and Baldwin, 2003), and we can relate
                bud and flower production to lifetime seed production, which is commonly accepted as
                a measure of Darwinian fitness (Baldwin,
                    1998; van Loon et al., 2000;
                    Hoballah and Turlings, 2001).We
                hypothesized that HIPVs would increase plant reproduction by increasing predation of
                herbivores, and that TPIs alone would not increase reproduction under herbivore
                attack, but would either increase predation or increase herbivores' susceptibility
                to predators. We then assembled a toolbox of wild-type and transgenic lines chosen
                to test these hypotheses.</alinea>
         </para>
         <para>
            <alinea>We chose a genotype of N. attenuata native to the Great Basin Desert
                of southwestern Utah. In many years, Manduca spp. larvae cause the
                most defoliation of N. attenuata plants in this area (Kessler and Baldwin, 2001) and thus the
                    N. attenuata 'UT' genotype is likely adapted to defend against
                    Manduca spp. Eggs and young larvae of Manduca
                spp. are predated by Geocoris spp. (big-eyed bugs) which occur
                naturally in the Utah habitat and are attracted to components of N.
                    attenuata's HIPV bouquet (Kessler and
                    Baldwin, 2001; Halitschke et al.,
                    2008; Skibbe et al., 2008).
                Specifically, Utah Geocoris spp. predators are attracted to the
                sesquiterpene (E)-&#x3b1;-bergamotene as well as green leaf volatiles
                (fatty acid-derived C6 aldehydes, alcohols and esters) (Kessler and Baldwin, 2001; Halitschke et al., 2008; Schuman et al., 2009). Green leaf volatiles,
                or GLVs, can be silenced via a single upstream 13-lipoxygenase,
                    NaLOX2, which specifically supplies lipid hydroperoxides for
                their production (Allmann et al., 2010).
                Although GLVs are released upon mechanical damage, the oral secretions (OS) of
                    M. sexta convert 3-(Z)-GLVs to the
                    2-(E)-structures, resulting in greater
                    Geocoris spp. predation than the damage-induced
                    (Z):(E) ratio (Allmann and Baldwin, 2010). GLVs are released immediately upon
                damage (Allmann and Baldwin, 2010) and may
                therefore be a 'first line of defense'.</alinea>

            <alinea>Like GLVs, many other HIPVs are also released after mechanical damage, but change in
                amount or ratio upon herbivory, and thus GLVs mirror the functional complexity of
                the total HIPV blend. Furthermore, GLVs prime or directly regulate responses in
                neighboring plants (Kessler et al., 2006;
                    Paschold et al., 2006), attract
                herbivores as well as predators (Halitschke et
                    al., 2008), and are important cues for pollinating and ovipositing moths
                    (Kessler and Baldwin, 2001, 2006; De
                    Moraes et al., 2001; Fraser et al.,
                    2003), thus performing several roles which may harm or benefit plant
                fitness in addition to their role in attracting predators. Perhaps most
                significantly, GLVs also stimulate Manduca spp. feeding, and
                silencing plant GLV production results in reduced herbivore damage (Halitschke et al., 2004; Meldau et al., 2009). All these qualities
                made the manipulation of GLV emissions an ideal means to test rigorously the fitness
                consequences of HIPV emissions and to evaluate whether these emissions can truly be
                considered defensive.</alinea>
